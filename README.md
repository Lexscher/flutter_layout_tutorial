# flutter_layout_tutorial

### UPDATE: This project is being put on hold.
### If you'd like to know why, please check out the readme from my [main flutter repository](https://github.com/Lexscher/flutter_bug).
----
This is my second flutter tutorial. I hope to build something really
cool in [my other repository](https://github.com/Lexscher/flutter_bug).

If you'd like to see what I create after I've finished this up, be sure to check
it out!

I found this tutorial, [here](https://flutter.io/tutorials/layout/).
It is meant to give you better foundation of layouts when using Flutter!

I'll try to make more commits this time around (_Please, pardon me if I forget_).

##### Thank you for taking an interest in my code.

### Best,
